## Motivation
This first thing I do on every new computer is to remap Caps Lock to Ctrl and Esc. Ctrl when the key is hold and Esc when tapped. This is an essential mapping with many use cases for coders but also for other users.

## Goal
The goal is to get keyboard/notebook manufacturers to adopt this as a new standard on their keyboards. Why should we stick to something nobody is using. I know there more things on a keyboard layout which could optimized but let's start small:

- This change would work with all keyboard layouts, ANSI, ISO, any language
- Apps don't remap Caps Lock out of the box, so no legacy software problems
- Nobody needs Caps Lock

## Next Steps
In order to get started I created this repo. We can discuss here the spec, how we move on and if this idea has any potential. Please create issues and pull request on anything you like to see.

To get visibility with keyboard and notebook manufacturers we need to achieve any kind of critical mass: If you think this thing should transform into more than just an idea but a new standard pls contribute to this repo, star and/or fork.
