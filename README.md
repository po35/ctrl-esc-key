This first thing I do on every new computer is to map Caps Lock to Ctrl and Esc. Ctrl when the key is hold and Esc when tapped. This is an essential mapping with many use cases for coders but also for other users in contrast to Caps Lock.

The goal should be to get keyboard and notebook manufacturers to adopt this as a new standard on their keyboards. Because why should we stick to something nobody uses. I know there more things which could optimized on a keyboard layout but this is the lowest hanging fruit:

- The change would work will keyboard layouts, ANSI, ISO, any language
- Apps don't remap Caps Lock out of the box, so no legacy problems
- Nobody needs Caps Lock

In order to get started I created this repo. We can discuss here together the spec, how we move on and if this idea has any potential. Please create issues and pull request on anything you like to see.

To get visibility with keyboard and notebook manufacturers we need to achieve any kind of critical mass: If you think this thing should transform into more than just an idea but a new standard pls contribute to this repo, star and/or fork.
